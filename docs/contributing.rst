Contributing
============

MSMBuilder is a collaborative project and we welcome all contributions.

Users
-----

If you find a bug or have a question, consider opening an `issue
<https://github.com/msmbuilder/msmbuilder/issues>`_. We're mainly grad
student researchers, not software developers or support staff, so have
patience if someone doesn't respond immediately. Don't be afraid to "bump"
a thread if it's been a couple days.

If you are an MSMBuilder user, we encourage you to "watch" the issue
tracker. The developers will often solicit feedback about design decisions
and features. Your input is important! You can also contribute by answering
other users' questions.


Developers
----------

To contribute a bug-fix or improvement, submit a pull request. Make sure
the changed code is `pep8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
compliant. Add a simple test case that would have failed but now passes
with your contribution. Make a note of the change in the :ref:`changelog<changelog>`
by editing ``docs/changelog.rst``. If you need help or clarification on any
of these points, open a pull request and we'll be more than happy to help.

To contribute a new feature, submit a pull request. The code should be
`pep8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ compliant. Include a
suite of tests to (1) verify your feature is working as intended and (2)
will not be broken in the future. Describe the feature in the
:ref:`changelog<changelog>` by editing ``docs/changelog.rst``. Provide literature
citations if applicable. Add an example IPython notebook that demonstrates
your new feature. It should run quickly and make a pretty plot.  If you
need help or clarification on any of these points, open a pull request and
we'll be more than happy to help.
