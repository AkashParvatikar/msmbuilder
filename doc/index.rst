    Statistical models for Biomolecular Dynamics</h2>

MSMBuilder is a python library and application which implements a series of
statistical models for high-dimensional time-series. The particular focus
of the package is on the analysis of atomistic simulations of biomolecular
dynamics such as protein folding and conformational change.

Algorithms available include:

-  :ref:`cluster`
-  :ref:`msm`
-  :ref:`decomposition`
-  :ref:`hmm`
-  :ref:`tpt`


MSMBuilder is developed by primarily by researchers at Stanford University
and Memorial Sloan Kettering, but we welcome contributions. The development
all takes place on `Github <https://github.com/msmbuilder/msmbuilder>`_.
MSMBuilder is licensed under the GNU LGPL (v2.1 or later).
