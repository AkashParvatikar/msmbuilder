MSMBuilder -- Statistical models for Biomolecular Dynamics
==========================================================

MSMBuilder is a python package which implements a series of statistical
models for high-dimensional time-series -- the particular focus of the
library is on the analysis of atomistic simulations of biomolecular
dynamics such as protein folding and conformational change.

MSMBuilder is under active development. Many of the algorithms and models
implemented are "mature", but others are rapidly changing.

Algorithms available include:

-  :ref:`cluster`
-  :ref:`msm`
-  :ref:`tica`
-  :ref:`hmm`
-  :ref:`tpt`


MSMBuilder is developed by primarily by researchers at Stanford University and
Memorial Sloan Kettering, but we welcome contributions. The development all
takes place on `Github <https://github.com/msmbuilder/msmbuilder>`_. MSMBuilder is
licensed under the GNU LGPL (v2.1 or later).
