v3.0.0 (January 9, 2015)
------------------------
MSMBuilder 3.0 is a complete rewrite of our `previous work <https://github.com/msmbuilder/msmbuilder-legacy>`_. The focus is on power
and extensibility, with a much wider class of estimators and models supported
throughout the codebase. All users are encouraged to switch to MSMBuilder 3.0.
Pre-release versions of MSMBuilder 3.0 were called mixtape.
