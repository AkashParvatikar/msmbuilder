Changelog
=========

v3.3 (Unreleased)
-----------------

- ``GaussianHMM`` and ``VonMisesHMM`` is rewritten to feature higher code reuse
  and code quality (#583, #582, #584, #572, #570).
- ``KDTree`` can find n nearest points to e.g. a cluster center (#599).
- ``PCCAPlus`` is compatible with scipy 0.16 (#620).
- Documentation improvements (#618, #608, #604, #602)
- Test improvements, especially for Windows (#593, #590, #588, #579, #578,
  #577, #576)
- The command line flag for featurizers ``--out`` now saves the featurizer as
  a pickle file. This is consistent with other command-line commands
  (#546).
- Bug fix: ``MarkovStateModel.sample()`` produced trajectories of incorrect
  length. This function is still deprecated (#556).
- ``Slicer`` featurizer can slice feature arrays as part of a pipeline
  (#567).

v3.2 (April 14, 2015)
---------------------

- ``tICA`` ignores too-short trajectories during fitting instead of raising
  an exception
- New methods for sampling from MSM models
- Datasets can be opened in "append" mode
- Compatibility with scipy 0.16
- ``utils.dump`` saves using the pickle protocol. ``utils.load`` is backwards
  compatible.
- The command line flag for featurizers ``--out`` is deprecated. Use
  ``--transformed`` instead. This is consistent with other command-line
  commands.
- Bug fixes

v3.1 (Feb 27, 2015)
-------------------

- Numerous improvements to ``ContinuousTimeMSM`` optimization
- Switch ``ContinuousTimeMSM.score`` to transmat-style GMRQ
- New example dataset with Muller potential
- Assorted bug fixes in the command line layer

v3.0.1 (January 9, 2015)
------------------------

- Fix missing file on PyPI.


v3.0.0 (January 9, 2015)
------------------------

MSMBuilder 3.0 is a complete rewrite of our `previous work
<https://github.com/msmbuilder/msmbuilder-legacy>`_. The focus is on power
and extensibility, with a much wider class of estimators and models
supported throughout the codebase. All users are encouraged to switch to
MSMBuilder 3.0.  Pre-release versions of MSMBuilder 3.0 were called
mixtape.
